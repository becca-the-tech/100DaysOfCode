                    alt="table displaying list of books, author, number of pages, audiobook length, and a column for if the book is currently  checked out in the library">
                <p>This list was created so I can keep track between library books and books I own, whether ebook or
                    audiobook, on what I'm currently reading. I like being able to see how many pages each book has and
                    computing how much time I expect it to take to finish an audiobook or ebook, so JS does the
                    computing for me based on percent done with the book.</p>

                <h4>Random Quote Generator</h4>
                <img src="images/random_quote_generator.png"
                    alt="list of 6 quotes on a page with the author (and book for some) where the quote came from, with an option to add another quote, and with icons to favorite a quote and to add it to a writing list">
                <p>These quotes come from my Kindles dating back to 2014. I used Node's FS module to parse the kindle's
                    "My Clippings.txt" file, and then saved the parsed data to MongoDB so there
                    are over 1000 quotes listed. This page displays a random result of 6 quotes each time you refresh,
                    and each quote has an icon to favorite it or add it to a writing list (since I have a physical
                    journal I write quotes in).</p>

                    alt="lists series of courses and within the courses are modules and the expected time for completion">
                <p>This project was created so I could keep track of various video tutorials and each module's progress
                    visually, across multiple platforms. Data saved to MongoDB, routes with
                    Express, and lots of interactivity and dynamically calculated information.</p>

                    alt="boxes for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals, along with a priorities box and a gratitude box">
                <p>These boxes save data to localStorage and just create a nice visual for me to save data into my
                    bullet journal when I'm ready to write info down</p>

                <p>Pretty todo list that has a nice animation when trash button is clicked, can save items in local
                    storage and retrieves those items from local storage</p>

                    alt="two random colors in a linear gradient, with a box displaying what rgb values generate that gradient">
                <p>This simplistic project just uses vanilla JS to randomly pick values for the rgb of 2-3 colors and
                    then converts them into a gradient background each time the button is pressed. Helps me come up with
                    new backgrounds for many of my projects.</p>
