        <h1>100 Days of Code-- starting 4/30/2022</h1>
        <p class="intro">My goal is to spend at least 1 hour of coding a day for the next 100 days. 100 days from now is
            8/8, but to
            account for vacations or days when I'm too tired to work, I will give myself until 9/18 (141 days from
            today).
            Since I want to work daily, I will try to track what I worked on and how long I spent, but I have to spend
            at
            least 1 hour of study or coding for it to count (over hours on other days do not count towards this goal).
        </p>

                </ul>
                <p> I felt comfortable using the D&D API and Postman when testing the API to get data displayed, also
                    feeling like I have a much firmer grasp on Promises and Async-Await syntax. Still need to take notes
                    on DOM manipulation methods

                <p> Troubleshooting localStorage, tried to add an array to localStorage, but then it was splitting my
                    array even further into character elements instead of strings. Couldn't figure out in short time
                    limit, so instead switched to 3 hard-coded goals for now
