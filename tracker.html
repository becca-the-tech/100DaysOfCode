        <h1>100 Days of Code-- starting 4/30/2022</h1>
        <p class="intro">My goal is to spend at least 1 hour of coding a day for the next 100 days. 100 days from now is
            8/8, but to
            account for vacations or days when I'm too tired to work, I will give myself until 9/18 (141 days from
            today).
            Since I want to work daily, I will try to track what I worked on and how long I spent, but I have to spend
            at
            least 1 hour of study or coding for it to count (over hours on other days do not count towards this goal).
        </p>

                <p> I felt comfortable using the D&D API and Postman when testing the API to get data displayed, also
                    feeling like I have a much firmer grasp on Promises and Async-Await syntax. Still need to take notes
                    on DOM manipulation methods

                <p> Troubleshooting localStorage, tried to add an array to localStorage, but then it was splitting my
                    array even further into character elements instead of strings. Couldn't figure out in short time
                    limit, so instead switched to 3 hard-coded goals for now

                </ul>
                <p>Working with Open Books API to put in ISBNs and store the title results in LocalStorage. Worked on a
                    simple Tailwind project (landing page) and hosted it on Netlify. Also worked to create the outline
                    of my portfolio with a bio blurb, struggled fixing the images on the side, will return to that in
                    the future.

                </ul>
                <p>Figured out that JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() are needed with localStorage to use arrays so that
                    they don't get converted to strings. My code for this project is ugly and shows the usefulness of
                    modular code frameworks like React since I had to mass change variable names this way. This was just
                    a way to make it purely functional for the time being. I had fun picking out gradients using my
                    gradient-picker project.

                <p> Basics of React, uses the virtual DOM to only update parts of DOM that get changed. JSX's html code
                    has to have only one parent element, can be wrapped in parentheses to span multiple lines and
                    encompass all children elements, curly brackets used to embed JS within JSX, has to use className
                    and camelCase for event handlers like onclick in regular HTML becomes onClick and mouseover becomes
                    mouseOver

                    align-items, and flex-direction. Align-items default is stretch, justify-content default is
                    flex-start.
